# Assessment: Fundamentals of Data Analysis, Autumn 2022

This repository serves as my assessment for the Fundamentals of Data Analysis module, a constituent module of the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics at the Atlantic Technological University, Ireland. As part of the course, we were given tasks each week with a single deadline at the end of term; all of the notebooks associated with these tasks are tores in the Practicals (ADD LINK) sub-folder.

I have stored any notebooks or PDF files that we received as part of the course in the [Materials](\materials) section of this repository, just so I had this information to hand while I was working through it, and also so that I could easily reference any of the lecturer's remarks. Some of these are heavily annotated by myself, while others are less so; in any case, these are equivalent to any margin scribbles I would have done in a book-based module.

Special thanks to my friend Richard Bilsborough who has studied undergraduate economics and answered a ton of my questions, particular on entropy and logarithms. He provided the NIST article that is referenced in the second exercise.

## Using Jupyter Notebooks

- quick notes on how to open Jupyter Notebooks, common commands and features (Restart and run all, changing cells from markdown to code, etc.)

## Exercises

### **Exercise 1 - Information**

**Task**: Adapt the code in Ian's initial tutorials to generate a 1000 character-long string with weights based on the previous two characters.

**References**:

### **Exercise 2 - Logarithms**

**Task**: Explain why the log of zero is undefined.

### **Exercise 3a - Randomness**

**Task**: It is somewhat interesting that (5*4*3*2*1) perfectly divides (10*9*8*7*6), there is no remainder. If we only wanted exactly four heads as opposed to five, the equivalent calculation would be (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1). Does that evenly divide too? What is the formula in general? Does it always come out as a positive whole number?

### **Exercise 3b - Randomness**

**Task**: Note that there are the same number of way to get 4 tails as there are to get 4 heads. Explain why this is.

### **Exercise 4 - Distributions**

**Task**: Plot bar charts of histograms of any three different distributions listed at this [link](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generator.html#distributions).
