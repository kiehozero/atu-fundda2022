    "<b>The National Lottery</b> - Every week since the early 1990s my dad has picked the same lottery numbers: 6, 13, 17, 21, 32 and 44. He buys his ticket on Saturday evening about an hour before the cut-off ahead of the draw. The only thing more likely than those numbers not coming up is my mum asking why he bothers, and the reply that the one week he doesn't do it is when his numbers will come out. Of course, any combination of numbers is equally likely to arise, but if he did not get a ticket, and if the numbers did indeed come out, no amount of discussion with either a statistician or his subsequent prison psychologist would persuade him otherwise. My dad mistakenly believes that the numbers he picked, a combination of ages and birthdays, has an outsized significance compared to any other set of numbers, and that they therefore have a greater chance of being picked together.\n",

    "<b>Survivorship bias</b> - I love this example because the picture just sums it up so well (at least more so than the photo of Marty Whelan I used in the first example). Abraham Wald worked in a research group at Columbia University in New York, tasked with helping the American military minimise losses on bombing runs. Wald's group was tasked with working out the optimum amount and location of armour on these planes, without over-exposing them either through under-protection or by slowing them down with too much weight. The image above displays the areas most impacted by enemy ammunition on returning aircraft, and the image below, taken from an article by Jordan Ellenberg on [Medium](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*p5OvFPF077pgTh7ccEkfVw.jpeg), displays the initial dataset that the US Air Force provided:\n",

    "The intuition of the military officers was to add armour in the most impacted areas. Wald pointed out that it was unlikely that the Axis gunners were so accurate from a couple of thousand feet below to never hit the engines, and recommended instead that the dataset was fundamentally incomplete; the chance of a plane surviving a hit to the engine or the fuel lines were low enough that it had impacted the data they had collected.\n",
