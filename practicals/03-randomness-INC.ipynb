    "## Task: It is somewhat interesting that ( 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 ) perfectly divides ( 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 ), there is no remainder. If we only wanted exactly four heads as opposed to five, the equivalent calculation would be ( 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 ) / ( 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 ). Does that evenly divide too? What is the formula in general? Does it always come out as a positive whole number?"
