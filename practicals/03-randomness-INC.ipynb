    "## It is somewhat interesting that ( 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 ) perfectly divides ( 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 ), there is no remainder. If we only wanted exactly four heads as opposed to five, the equivalent calculation would be ( 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 ) / ( 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 ). Does that evenly divide too? What is the formula in general? Does it always come out as a positive whole number?"

    "- essentially the first digit in the first brackets is the number of blank spaces at the start of the process. This reduces in increments of 1, until the point where it is possible that filling every space meets the required threshold. So it is possible to meet the required four heads in only four slots, when that fourth 1 fills the seventh remaining blank spot. On the right side of the calc, the first digit represents the threshold, and also then is multipled by that value minus 1, repeating down to 1.\n",
